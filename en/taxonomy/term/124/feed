&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Researchers have developed a dermal patch with a blend of natural healing agents and polymers in a bilayer structure for improved wound healing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Wound dressings have evolved considerably from the herbal concoctions and magical potions that were popularly accepted as therapy, until the 19th century. Today, wound care is no longer just using a piece of gauze dipped in Dettol. With bioactive agents, nanoparticles, antioxidant agents, growth factors, polymers and more, the science of wound healing is advancing continually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;In a recent study, Prof. Prakriti Tayalia and her team from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay have developed an affordable bilayered bandage with antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The top layer consists of polycaprolactone (a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable&quot;&gt;biodegradable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester&quot;&gt;polyester&lt;/a&gt;) and chitosan (a sugar found in the outer skeleton of shellfishes). The bottom layer is made of polyvinyl alcohol (a water-soluble synthetic polymer) with curcumin (an anti-inflammatory compound found in plants of the turmeric family) nanoparticles and soluble eggshell membrane protein. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nano.2021.102495&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; was published in the journal Nanomedicine: Nanotechnology, Biology, and Medicine, with the lead author being Dr. Mamatha M. Pillai, who is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;There are, currently, more than 3000 different wound healing dressings available in the market, each being appropriate for specific wound types, that is for wounds that are more severe than the average paper cut. But, even with this plethora of choices, wounds such as venous ulcers, pressure ulcers, burn wounds, and diabetic wounds are challenging to treat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The impediment in the case of chronic and acute wounds – that are complex and hence do not progress through a regular sequence of skin repair – is the poor antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of the dressing leading to drying up of the wounded area and the requirement for frequent change of the dressings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Now, it makes sense for a dressing to be antibiotic or antiseptic. But why are the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of a wound dressing so significant? Well, when a body is wounded, it goes into a frenzy of molecular operations to heal itself. An abundance of fighter blood cells, clotting factors, and other mediators arrive at the wound site in phases to „help‟. In certain cases such as chronic wounds, the frenzied efforts of the body to heal itself end up being more harmful than beneficial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Chronic wounds do not easily surpass the inflammatory stage of wound healing, during which the molecular operations focus on removing damaged cells and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.physio-pedia.com/Bacterial_Infections&quot;&gt;bacteria &lt;/a&gt;from the wound site. This leads chronic wounds to accumulate inflammatory molecules and free radicals at the wound site that prevent it from entering the next stage, which is the reconstruction phase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;In such scenarios, especially with severe wounds, the wounds would benefit from dressings equipped with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, while remaining non-toxic. The dressing must also allow absorption of excess wound discharge while at the same time maintaining a moist milieu for the cells to heal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The dermal patch proposed by the IIT Bombay team meets all these criteria. It includes in the top layer polycaprolactone and chitosan. Polycaprolactone is commonly used in tissue engineering due to its water repelling, biocompatible and biodegradable properties and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, United States (FDA). The polymer chitosan, also FDA approved, is antibacterial and biodegradable. The combination of these polymers serves as a moisture-repellent layer for maintaining the fluid balance at the wound site and providing a microbial barrier for advanced wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iitb.ac.in/sites/www.iitb.ac.in/files/reshigh/2022-06/pic2.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; height=&quot;418&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;For the bottom layer, the team used polyvinyl alcohol, which serves as an aqua sponge embedded with wound healing agents, an absorbent for wound discharge, and a moist ambience for the wound. As far as the wound healing agent is concerned, remember the good old days when one would apply turmeric paste on wounds for quick healing? Well, Prof. Prakriti Tayalia and her team used a bioactive component from turmeric – curcumin – for the dermal patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Curcumin is known to have potent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. They converted the curcumin to nanoparticles to make the curcumin more easily accessible at the wound site. They also used an eggshell membrane – the thin layer that‟s between the egg white and the shell – which contains a high volume of structural proteins that can expedite wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;“To our knowledge, there are no such wound dressings available that are polymer-based, dual-layered, topical in application with multifunctional properties, namely, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, leading to better wound healing properties. This invention is innovative, and we have filed a patent on it,” says Prof. Tayalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The researchers have studied and validated the wound healing properties of the dermal patches with multiple lab tests. They also tested the patches on rat models and observed improved wound healing in comparison to other commercially available dressings. Next, the researchers plan to test it on diabetic and other chronic wounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Since the materials used to develop the patch are easily accessible, the process can be effectively scaled up for industrial mass-production of the patches for the market. The patches are only a couple of millimeters thick and can be manufactured in any size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;“This patch will undoubtedly be beneficial to people suffering from both chronic and acute wounds and we want to commercialize this product,” Prof. Tayalia signs off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;68*&quot; /&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;188*&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;26%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article written by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;74%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savitha Sekhar Nair&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;26%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image/ Graphic Credit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;74%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientifickly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;26%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gubbi labs link:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;74%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nano.2021.102495&quot;&gt;Novel combination of bioactive agents in bilayered dermal patches provides superior wound healing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/bioscience-and-bioengineering&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bioscience and Bioengineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/healthcare&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/science&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/society&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Researchers use mass spectrometry to determine the intensity of Covid-19 infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;India’s Covid-19 cases saw a massive surge in March and April 2021. The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic put a lot of pressure on the medical infrastructure. Appropriate medical facilities were at times not available to those who needed them most—the ones who had severe symptoms. There was no way to predict how severe the symptoms of an infected person could become. The golden test to check for Covid-19, the RT-PCR test can only tell whether a person is infected or not. Unfortunately, the test cannot determine the severity of the infection.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Researchers from the Indian Institute for Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) and Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Mumbai, led by Prof Sanjeeva Srivastava of IIT Bombay, have found that levels of specific proteins in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;nasopharyngeal samples of a person can differentiate between low and high severity of infection. This information would help hospitals distribute healthcare resources on time and ensure that those who require critical care could be identified with relative ease. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221001036&quot;&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;was published in iScience, an open-access journal from Cell Press. The study was funded by the Council of Scientific &amp;amp; Industrial Research (CSIR) and by IIT Bombay.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The commonly used RT-PCR test uses a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to detect the virus’s nucleic acid. But specific viral or host proteins, released at different stages of infection, have stories to tell. By identifying which protein is released at which stage, we can &lt;/span&gt;determine the severity of the disease. Mass spectrometry is a tool that can find if a particular protein is present and in what percentage in a sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;But first, the researchers needed to check if mass spectrometry could be used as a primary diagnostic test to confirm Covid-19 infection. Separate tests for detecting and measuring the severity of Covid-19 would only increase the work of the already burdened medical staff. The researchers collected nasopharyngeal samples from three groups of patients; Covid-19 positive, Covid-19 negative and Covid-19 recovered. They used mass spectrometry to determine which proteins were present in each of the groups’ samples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The researchers compared the protein profiles of Covid-19 positive and Covid-19 negative samples. They identified 25 proteins that were upregulated or present in higher quantities in Covid positive patients. They verified the 25 proteins’ identities and quantities using a mass spectrometry technique called the Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) assay. While mass spectrometry can identify any biomolecule, an SRM assay is targeted at just proteins. Therefore, SRM is a highly sensitive and selective method for the identification of proteins and the precise measurement of their quantities.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;These 25 proteins could potentially be used to determine whether a sample is Covid positive or Covid negative. A quantitative clinical study on a larger cohort needs to be done to determine the cutoff percentages of the identified proteins. It would allow mass spectrometry to be used as a diagnostic test.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The researchers used Covid-19 recovered samples to identify whether these proteins also indicated progression towards severity or recovery. Thus, Covid-19 recovered patients were used as another control to narrow down the list of significant proteins that were altered only in the positive patients.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The second step was to find proteins that differentiated severe cases from non-severe ones. The 24 Covid-19 positive samples consisted of 11 non-severe and 13 severe patient samples. A patient is said to have high severity if they have acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia or an oxygen saturation level below 87%. The researchers analysed the samples of the severe and non-severe groups separately. They identified six significant proteins that could differentiate severe Covid-19 patients from non-severe ones.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Proteins take part in cellular activities through step-by-step processes. Each step of a process may require particular proteins. The researchers studied the role that the six identified proteins played in the cellular processes in humans. A Covid-19 infection alters these processes, leading to higher levels of the six identified proteins. Thus, creating drugs that inhibit the significant proteins would lower the severity of the infection.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The researchers wanted to check if any existing drugs could be used to target the identified proteins rather than waiting for a new drug to be designed. The advantage of using existing drugs is that they are verified for safety. In the lab, the researchers investigated the binding efficiency of current drugs (29 FDA-approved, nine clinical, and 20 pre-clinical trial drugs) to the proteins involved in altered cellular processes in the infected host. By doing this, the researchers identified several drug candidates and small molecules, which could potentially bind to and inhibit the significant proteins.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;“Drug development is a costly and time-consuming process. Thus it is important to find an alternative therapeutic approach for dealing with Covid-19,” explains Dr Kruthi, one of the authors of the study. “Most of these drugs are FDA approved and are in use for combating other groups of diseases. Thus, these drugs have the potential for Covid-19 therapy.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Mass spectrometry could potentially be used as a diagnostic and prognostic test. Further studies on a large cohort of Covid-19 positive and Covid-19 negative samples in order to validate these results need to be done. A quantitative analysis of the identified proteins needs to be conducted. Further tests inside human cells need to be done to validate these small molecules and drug candidates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;211&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Articlewritten by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;351&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;AishwaryaViswamitra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;211&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;ImageCredits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;351&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;IIT Bombay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;211&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;GubbiPages Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;351&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102135&quot;&gt;Proteomic investigation reveals dominant alterations of neutrophil degranulation and mRNA translation pathways in patients with &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/bioscience-and-bioengineering&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bioscience and Bioengineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Antibiotics are widely used to treat bacterial infections in humans and animals. They are even used in household items such as floor cleaners and soaps. Antibiotics enter the environment from these sources and contaminate our food and water, giving a chance to the bacteria to become resistant to the medicines, which could earlier kill them. It means that the drugs we could use to treat a particular disease may no longer be effective.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;We need to monitor the level of antibiotics in our milk and meat or the water around us to ensure that it is minimal. A group of scientists, led by Prof. Soumyo Mukherji, in the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) and Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, have developed a sensor to find out whether a sample contains certain kinds of antibiotics, identified as β-lactam antibiotics. They published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c04169&quot;&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;about this in the journal Analytical Chemistry.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;There are different methods to check if a sample contains an antibiotic, but they cannot determine the level of the said antibiotic. Other methods such as Mass Spectroscopy or standardized chromatography can measure the levels of antibiotics but are expensive and require experts to handle them. In contrast, the sensor developed by Prof Mukherji and team is easy to use, affordable, robust and reliable. It can be used to check the presence of β-lactam antibiotics in a wide variety of samples, including water, milk and meat and does not require an expert to use it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Penicillin and similar antibiotics like cephalosporin are called β-lactam antibiotics. They derive their name from the presence of a ring containing nitrogen in their molecular structure. The antibiotics can kill a wide variety of microorganisms, making them a popular drug of choice not only for the treatment of minor infection but also as an ingredient in various household products such as floor cleaners and soaps and food products such as milk and poultry. The β-lactam ring works by targeting the cell wall of the bacteria, thereby destroying the bacteria. The microorganisms resistant to the antibiotics evade destruction by secreting an enzyme called β-lactamase that breaks the β-lactam ring, thus rendering the antibiotic useless.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The sensor has a U shaped bend smaller than that of a U-pin, of optical fibre coated with polyaniline that can be dipped in the sample to be tested. The sensor is ready to be used after coating the polyaniline with a layer of the enzyme β-lactamase. When β-lactam in the test sample gets broken down by the β-lactamase enzyme, hydrogen ions are released, and acid byproducts form. This alters the polymeric backbone of polyaniline- changing its form from emeraldine base to emeraldine salt. This is seen as an increase in absorbance at 435 nm and the amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of antibiotic in the test sample making the solution more acidic. The light is absorbed by the polyaniline coat on the fibre that is sensitive to pH. The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the antibiotic in the test sample.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The researchers used their sensor to measure the concentration of antibiotics in milk, meat, and wastewater samples that contained a known amount of the antibiotic. The researchers found that the sensor was most sensitive when the sample was slightly acidic (pH 5.5); hence, they used the same acidity level for other samples. The minimum concentration of antibiotics that the sensor could detect for wastewater was twice that of milk.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The scientists found the sensor is considerably less sensitive to antibiotics in meat as compared to milk. However, given that there are hardly any sensors to detect antibiotics in meat, this is a significant advantage. Since most food safety administrators ban the use of β- lactam antibiotics in poultry, this is particularly useful.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The sensor development was not free from challenges. Calibrating the sensor for use and making it sensitive to detect the lowest possible antibiotic concentration across different samples was one of the biggest challenges, says Dr Pooja.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The scientists also checked if the sensor was specific to β-lactam antibiotics. They observed that when the sensor was used in a solution containing other antibiotics, it did not detect the antibiotics.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;When not coated with the enzyme, the sensors can be stored for a long time. However, once the enzyme is coated, the sensor must be kept at 4℃. When manufactured on a large scale, the sensor could cost less than ₹30-35. It is much cheaper as compared to more than ₹3000 needed for the conventional techniques in use today. Moreover, each sensor can be used &lt;/span&gt;twice, which further reduces the testing cost. The researchers have applied for a patent for the sensor and are awaiting approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;151&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Article written by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;488&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Nagashree Avabhrath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;151&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Image Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;488&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Savitha Sekhar, Research Matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;151&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Gubbi page link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;488&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c04169&quot;&gt;Evanescent Wave Optical Fiber Sensors using Enzymatic Hydrolysis on Nanostructured Polyaniline for Detection of β-lactam Antibio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/bioscience-and-bioengineering&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bioscience and Bioengineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/food&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Sometimes, due to exposure to harmful chemicals or intense radiation, or even during internal duplication, genes inside few cells can get damaged. At times, the damage makes the cells deviate from their usual behaviour and go rogue. The rogue cells increase in number and form an unholy band that do not respect boundaries and suck even the nutrients meant for healthy cells. These cells are what we call cancer. Gradually and stealthily, they invade new territories and spread to other parts of the body. At this stage, cancer is generally considered to be untreatable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer mass is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-017-0600-4&quot;&gt;mixture of cells &lt;/a&gt;with properties slightly different from each other. Cells differ in size and flexibility or stiffness. In some types of cancer, different types of cells assemble and move together. Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article-abstract/134/7/jcs250225/238125/Combined-heterogeneity-in-cell-size-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article-abstract/134/7/jcs250225/238125/Combined-heterogeneity-in-cell-size-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that such a rogue hunting party containing a mixture of different cancer cells is more invasive than a band of soldier-like uniform cells. Researchers ran computer models that they had developed and found that typically small and soft cells are most invasive. They also pointed out that smaller cells that resemble cancer stem cells are most often found at the forefront of invasion. Their study was published in The Company of Biologists’ Journal of Cell Science. This research work received funding from the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;All the cells in our body are embedded in a matrix made of proteins and other chemicals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;As cancer advances, the cancer cells start invading new tissues. It is not easy for cells to move through dense sticky matrices. Cancer cells secrete several enzymes to soften the matrix and help them wade through it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers chose two types of breast cancer cells that were primed for an invasion.They analyzed how big each kind of cell is and how strongly each cell binds to its neighbour. Additionally, they measured how fast the cells move around and how stiff they are. Using computer simulations, they observed how these cells moved around and invaded new parts of the body. They controlled the size and stiffness of the cells or their stickiness towards each other. Also, in the simulations they mixed different types of cells in different proportions. They calculated the total distance that each cell travelled. They observed how far each cell moved from its original place, which is termed as the translocation of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translocation is a better indicator of invasiveness than the distance each cell travels. Like football players who can pass around the ball a lot and yet fail to break the defence, cells can also move around but still fail to invade new territory. The researchers found that translocation as a whole for a group of cells was maximum in groups that consisted of cells different from each other in size and stiffness. Interestingly, the groups of cells that consisted of cells differing in size alone or stiffness alone were not very efficient invaders. They found that a combination of cells of different sizes and stiffness was the most aggressively invading combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers created five different groups of cells. They tested the invasiveness of each group independently to find whether any specific combination of a particular size or stiffness was the most invasive. All cells in each group were uniform but had size or stiffness different from cells in other groups. They found that there was a negligible difference in the invasiveness of each of the individual groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is a heterogeneous mixture of cells so efficient at invading? The explanation provided is very reminiscent of a pretty successful strategy in football called „Total Football‟. The Dutch football team is known to have practiced it in the 1970s. As opposed to „formations‟, where the players play in fixed positions, in Total Football, players move around fluidly and replace another player‟s position, effectively maintaining full pressure of attack on the opponent‟s defence. What we observe with the cells here is similar to this strategy. “Heterogeneity enables cells to continuously re-position individual cells within a collectively moving group of cells. This enhances the net invasiveness of the cell population,” explains Dr Sen, who led the current research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer mass contains cancer stem cells that can endlessly increase in numbers, just like normal stem cells. Experimental studies have pointed out that some of these stem cells are relatively softer and smaller in size and are found at the leading front. These simulation studies also found that the same smaller cells were found at the leading front of the invasion. The less invasive cells of the group follow these more aggressive leader cells and strengthen the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True to the adage that diversity in a team imparts the ability to solve a complex problem, a mixed bag of cells with different sizes and stiffness is the most efficient combination for cancer cells to invade. In this heterogeneous group, the cells are interacting with each other during the invasion. One day we may be able to exploit this interaction to kill the cancer cells. We may evolve a strategy to interfere with this crosstalk and hinder their invasion. Perhaps we may then be able to outwit cancer even at this final invasion stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;194&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Article  written by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;430&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Manohar G M&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;194&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Image Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;430&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Savitha Sekhar, Research Matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;194&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Gubbi page link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;430&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: &#039;Times New Roman&#039;,&#039;serif&#039;; mso-fareast-font-family: &#039;Times New Roman&#039;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;page-break-before: always; mso-break-type: section-break;&quot; clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article-abstract/134/7/jcs250225/238125/Combined-heterogeneity-in-cell-size-and?redirectedFrom=fulltext&quot;&gt;Combined heterogeneity in cell size and deformability promotes cancer invasiveness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/bioscience-and-bioengineering&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Bioscience and Bioengineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In their latest study published in Molecular Biology and Evolution, the researchers show that giant viruses may have come from a complex single-cell ancestor, keeping DNA replication machinery but shedding genes that code for other vital processes like metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2003 was a big year for virologists. The first giant virus was discovered in this year, which shook the virology scene, revising what was thought to be an established understanding of this elusive group and expanding the virus world from simple, small agents to forms that are as complex as some bacteria. Because of their link to disease and the difficulties in defining them—they are biological entities but do not fit comfortably in the existing tree of life—viruses incite the curiosity of many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long been interested in how viruses evolved, especially when it comes to giant viruses that can produce new viruses with very little help from the host—in contrast to most small viruses, which utilize the host’s machinery to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though giant viruses are not what most people would think of when it comes to viruses, they are actually very common in oceans and other water bodies. They infect single-celled aquatic organisms and have major effects on the latter’s population. In fact, Dr. Kiran Kondabagil, molecular virologist at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, suggests, “Because these single-celled organisms greatly influence the carbon turnover in the ocean, the viruses have an important role in our world’s ecology. So, it is just as important to study them and their evolution, as it is to study the disease-causing viruses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, the findings of which have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/5/2014/6133233&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published in Molecular Biology and Evolution&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Kondabagil and co-researcher Dr. Supriya Patil performed a series of analyses on major genes and proteins involved in the DNA replication machinery of Mimivirus, the first group of giant viruses to be identified. They aimed to determine which of two major suggestions regarding Mimivirus evolution—the reduction and the virus-first hypotheses—were more supported by their results. The reduction hypothesis suggests that the giant viruses emerged from unicellular organisms and shed genes over time; the virus-first hypothesis suggests that they were around before single-celled organisms and gained genes, instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mimivirus is one of the largest viruses ever discovered, and how it came to be has remained one of the great biological mysteries. Scientists from IIT Bombay have now shed some light on exactly that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kondabagil and Dr. Patil created phylogenetic trees with replication proteins and found that those from Mimivirus were more closely related to eukaryotes than to bacteria or small viruses. Additionally, they used a technique called multidimensional scaling to determine how similar the Mimiviral proteins are. A greater similarity would indicate that the proteins co-evolved, which means that they are linked together in a larger protein complex with coordinated function. And indeed, their findings showed greater similarity. Finally, the researchers showed that genes related to DNA replication are similar to and fall under purifying selection, which is natural selection that removes harmful gene variants, constraining the genes and preventing their sequences from varying. Such a phenomenon typically occurs when the genes are involved in essential functions (like DNA replication) in an organism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iitb.ac.in/sites/www.iitb.ac.in/files/resize/reshigh/2021-05/pic2-521x1298.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;521&quot; height=&quot;1298&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these results imply that Mimiviral DNA replication machinery is ancient and evolved over a long period of time. This narrows us down to the reduction hypothesis, which suggests that the DNA replication machinery already existed in a unicellular ancestor, and the giant viruses were formed after getting rid of other structures in the ancestor, leaving only replication-related parts of the genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings are very exciting because they inform how life on earth has evolved,” Dr. Kondabagil says. “Because these giant viruses probably predate the diversification of the unicellular ancestor into bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, they should have had major influence on the subsequent evolutionary trajectory of eukaryotes, which are their hosts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of applications beyond this contribution to basic scientific knowledge, Dr. Kondabagil feels that their work could lay the groundwork for translational research into technology like genetic engineering and nanotechnology. He says, “An increased understanding of the mechanisms by which viruses copy themselves and self-assemble means we could potentially modify these viruses to replicate genes we want or create nanobots based on how the viruses function. The possibilities are far-reaching!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;308&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;308&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiran Kondabagil and Supriya Patil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;308&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo courtesy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;308&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shutterstock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;308&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;308&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular Biology and Evolution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Dr. Kiran Kondabagil from IIT Bombay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kondabagil is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay.
