Ever wondered what they are? Blockchain is a distributed digital database that is shared using a computer network. It records transactions and tracks ownership of assets such as cryptocurrencies, land records and goods in the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;A team from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) led by Prof. Manoj Prabhakaran, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, is a part of one of the ten teams selected by the Algorand Foundation under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algorand.foundation/ace&quot;&gt;Algorand Centres of Excellence (ACEs)&lt;/a&gt; Program. Prof. Vinay Ribeiro and Prof Umesh Bellur, also from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, are the co-leaders. The ACE program aims to award USD 50 million (about 400 crore Indian rupees) among the ten teams over five years. The Algorand program received 77 proposals with more than 550 participants representing 46 countries. An international panel of 27 experts from diverse disciplines selected the winners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Cryptocurrency, which has blockchain technology at its backbone, is gaining momentum worldwide. Some well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin require power-heavy processing on several computers connected in the network to record a single transaction. Due to the high power consumption, the carbon emission is high, raising questions about its environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Algorand is a company that designs blockchain technology and aims to have no negative impact on the environment by reducing power consumption and, thereby, carbon emission. Algorand Foundation attempts to grow a carbon-negative ecosystem using Algorand blockchain technology in various areas. “The Algorand blockchain technology uses a design and protocol that requires less computational power than other cryptocurrency implementations, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, making Algorand carbon-negative,” explains Prof Ribeiro. Algorand claims to dedicate a part of every transaction fee for the purpose of carbon offsetting. In its pursuit to aid research in green blockchain technology, the company is setting up Algorand Centres of Excellence (ACE) across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Blockchain facilitates the transfer of ownership of assets via transactions which are recorded on blocks, similar to transactions of a bank being recorded on pages. Each block stores the mapping, called a hash value, of the previous block, which acts as a unique ID of the content of the previous block. This is termed cryptographic chaining of the blocks using hash pointers. The ownership information of the assets recorded in the blockchain cannot be arbitrarily modified; thus, integrity of information exists in the blockchain. The use of hash pointers ensures that the history of the transactions is tamper-proof. Often, this database of transactions, called a ledger, is not maintained by a single central server, but a community of participants maintains it. These participants get paid in cryptocurrencies for their services. Blockchains are best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency systems for maintaining a secure record of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay team is a part of a multi-institute endeavour, a 3- year project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algorand.foundation/ace-university/purdue-university&quot;&gt;MEGA-ACE led by Purdue University.&lt;/a&gt; MEGA-ACE is a multi-institute interdisciplinary collaboration network led and coordinated by the Purdue Blockchain Lab. It includes partners from top universities around the globe. The MEGA-ACE team consists of universities from North America, South America, Europe, Australia, Africa and Asia, including the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;“There are many reasons to take a closer look at blockchains,” explains Prof Prabhakaran. “For one, blockchains are still an immature technology, and many of the algorithmic and systems design choices are ad hoc. Indeed, one of the claims to fame for Algorand is that it pioneered a system that uses cryptographic techniques to do away with Bitcoin‟s computationally and ecologically expensive protocol for running a lottery. But this is not the end of the story. Our research at IIT Bombay looks into several other ways a blockchain-like system can be made more robust and efficient from theoretical and practical points of view. We are also interested in resolving some of the tension between transparency and secrecy that one encounters on such systems, using advanced cryptographic techniques like secure multi-party computation. Also, at MEGA-ACE, researchers will look into new and appropriate real-life applications of blockchain technologies and complex game-theoretic questions that arise when incentivizing real-life participants with cryptocurrencies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The bigger MEGA-ACE team has its roots in the theoretical cryptography community, of which Prof Manoj Prabhakaran has been a part. He has been conducting research in the field of Distributed Data Repositories. Prof Ribeiro and Prof Bellur are working on research areas focussing on increasing the number of transactions per second and reducing the time required for confirming a transaction in a blockchain. “Blockchains are a melting pot of several technologies, and at IIT Bombay, we have a good balance of theoreticians and practitioners who can work together on this topic,” remarks Prof Bellur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;IIT Bombay will receive around USD 350K (roughly 2.8 crore Indian Rupees) from the total grant of USD 8 million (about 64 crore Indian Rupees) to the MEGA-ACE project. The MEGA- ACE team aims to educate students across the globe with multi-lingual material. For IIT Bombay and other partner institutions, the project also aims to conduct collaborative events like workshops, schools, hackathons and blockchain days that encourage blockchain research. MEGA-ACE team aspires to find solutions in the Algorand ecosystem that address infrastructure problems in local communities in the countries of partnering institutes like IIT Bombay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;“Blockchain technologies are evolving fast, and their current applications are largely experimental in nature. But there is a great deal of interest from Indian enterprises and governments. Going forward, as these technologies become more robust and their potential for more efficient and transparent digital transactions become better understood, these technologies are likely to see more adoption,” concludes Prof Ribeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;128*&quot; /&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;128*&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article written by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shilpa Inamdar-Joshi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image/ Graphic Credit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientifickly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gubbi Labs Link:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &#039;Times New Roman&#039;, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iitb.ac.in/en/node/add/research-highlight&quot;&gt;IIT Bombay Team wins Algorand Grant for Blockchain Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/technology&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

This evolution in practice is due to the advancement of imaging technologies over the years, beginning with a modest ~16 frames per second (FPS) video by the 18th century Lumiere brothers to the immersive gaming environments with ~150 FPS. In addition to entertainment, can we utilise this technology to image and understand the human body&#039;s complex microscopic workings, such as neuron activity in the human brain?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;In an innovative step taken by the Photonics and Quantum Enabled Sensing Technology Lab, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, the laboratory lead Prof Kasturi Saha and her team exploit the capabilities of a specialised high FPS camera to get time-changing or ‘dynamic’ pictures of very weak magnetic fields, typical of what is found in neurons. A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12609-3&quot;&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;based on this work was published in the journal Scientific Reports.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;We use neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for studying the internal structure of the human brain. These techniques measure electromagnetic signals that provide a snapshot of combined neuron activity and help us study specific brain functions. Moreover, these signals are weak, so we need bulky, extremely powerful magnets in &lt;/span&gt;these technologies to detect them. Thus, how to increase our ability to detect such weak neuron signals using efficient technology is one of the urgent questions that the neuroscience and medical community at large are striving to answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Often, we find imperfections in the crystal lattice structure of diamonds, one of which includes a nitrogen atom located next to a vacancy in the diamond lattice. These nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centres have ‘unpaired’ electrons that are extremely sensitive to external triggers like magnetic fields and temperature, making them unique quantum probes to measure weak yet ultra-sensitive magnetic fields at microscopic levels. These changes can be directly measured by sensing low-intensity light, also known as ‘photoluminescence’, emitted from the interaction of these electrons with magnetic fields. The researchers harness these unique properties of NV centres into highly sensitive, atomic-size magnetometers that can map magnetic fields at such smaller physical scales.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The neuronal magnetic fields change much faster than how quickly the current NV-based magnetometers can capture the changes. With the current NV magnetometers, the capture takes a few minutes to a few hours for high-resolution images, and hence anything changing faster than that cannot be videographed and essentially gives us only a snapshot. Prof Saha and her team are the first group of researchers presenting a unique and experimentally efficient improvement by using a specialised readily available ‘lock-in’ camera in a magnetic field microscope setup bringing down the acquisition times from several minutes per frame to an order of 100 FPS. Globally this is the first time anyone has shown sub-second magnetic field microscopy with this technique.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;They set up the experiment by mounting a very thin sheet of pure diamond crystal with NV defects on two types of magnetic field sources - a very thin microscopic wire (or a ‘microwire’) and a microscopic coil of wire (or a ‘microcoil’). They introduce variation in the magnetic field by manipulating NV centre spins with microwave frequencies that change on the scale of milliseconds. This rapidly changing magnetic field is caught through the interaction in the NV defect centre within the diamond crystal layer, which results in low-light photoluminescence.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The ingenuity of this experiment, however, lies in how Prof Saha’s team utilised the high FPS lock-in camera to capture the changing magnetic field. As opposed to a conventional camera, in a lock-in camera, each pixel detects only light fluctuations that contain specific frequency or oscillations of a fixed time period and ‘rejects’ light fluctuations of other frequencies. This enhances the signal for the lock-in camera and hence, is suited in ultra-low light imaging scenarios like the photoluminescence from NV centres. As a result, they were able to get a &lt;/span&gt;‘motion picture’ of the magnetic field from the microwire and the microcoil by capturing each change of magnetic field by tuning the lock-in camera to capture the light emitted by NV centres. Says Madhur Parashar, the lead author of this work, “The experimental imaging setup is a magnetic field microscope, analogous to a standard light microscope. Therefore, it renders the ability to image microscopic (1 micron to around 100 micron scale) magnetic fields found in microcircuits with a current flow and can potentially be extended to imaging dynamic magnetic fields from biological cells like neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;NV-based microscopes thus have the potential to be a promising alternative technology for probing mammalian brain activity. Such a way of pushing the accuracy of sensing electromagnetic fields at the microscopic level using quantum properties of atomic constituents forms the crux of the upcoming new field of ‘Quantum sensing’. “In the context of India – Quantum Sensing is completely new, and our lab is the first to build such a quantum diamond microscope in the country. We can perform not only biological sensing but also explore quantum materials and many more,” concludes Prof Saha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Article written by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;KshitijaKelkar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Image/ Graphic Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Image:Setupoftheexperiment(Credit:ProfKasturiSaha)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Gubbi Lab Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12609-3&quot;&gt;Sub-second temporal magnetic field microscopy using quantum defects in diamond&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/engineering&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/science&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/technology&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389422000127&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, a research team led by Prof T.I.Eldho of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT Bombay), in collaboration with Dr Anil Lonappan of the Mangosuthu University of Technology, South Africa, has devised a new technique to detect micro and nano plastic in laboratory samples without destroying the ambient nature of the samples. The technique uses the changes induced in the electrical properties of a material when placed inside a microwave cavity to identify the material. The researchers hope to develop handheld devices to detect the presence of pollutants in environmental samples. The study was published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The challenges posed by plastic pollutants are well documented and have long since entered public debates. But in the last few years, studies have shed new light on another variety of plastic pollutants: nano and microplastics. Invisible to the naked eye and extremely small, these are found almost everywhere, from the pristine environments of the Antarctic to our internal organs. Studies have reported finding these tiny plastic fragments in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/53195056&quot;&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/53195056&quot;&gt;rop plants, edible fruits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-81499-8&quot;&gt;fishes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50621-2&quot;&gt;penguins&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/22/microplastics-revealed-in-placentas-unborn-babies&quot;&gt;human placenta.&lt;/a&gt; Additionally, they also appear to play a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-airborne-microplastics-affect-climate-change1/&quot;&gt;role in climate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-airborne-microplastics-affect-climate-change1/&quot;&gt;change.&lt;/a&gt; Researchers are still investigating the yet largely unknown environmental and health &lt;/span&gt;effects of micro and nano plastics. While emerging threats posed by micro and nano plastic pollutants are varied and significant, “a whole picture regarding the level of environmental contamination is unknown”, remarks Dr Renjith, who worked on the study during his postdoctoral research at IIT Bombay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;With awareness about micro and nanoplastics, there is a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eib.org/en/essays/plastic-pollution&quot;&gt;growing impetus &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;to prevent and control their spread. One of the challenges in combating them, especially regarding questions of health, is that existing techniques to identify the presence of these tiny plastic pollutants are mostly laboratory-based, energy intensive and require expertise to operate. Thus, energy efficient, fast and economically feasible alternatives are highly desirable. In this context, the IIT Bombay team explored the possibility of using microwave radiation to detect plastic pollutants. “Microwave processing requires less energy and time than other spectroscopic methods. Conventional methods may heat the sample from outside. As compared to such methods, the chances of sample degradation are less with microwaves”, explains Dr Renjith. Microwave-based techniques are also generally considered to be environmentally friendly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Microwave radiation interacts with various plastic polymers and alters some of its electrical properties. While low-frequency signals (upto 300 kHz) are used to study resistivity and conductivity, higher frequency signals(300 MHz to 4 GHz) are used to study dielectric parameters. In the current study, the researchers used microwave radiations in the S-band (2-4 GHz) and showed that the dielectric constant is useful in detecting plastics in both dry and wet samples. They also found two more properties, absorption loss and dielectric loss tangent, to be helpful in detecting plastics in dry samples.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Just as microwave radiation interacts with the water molecules in the food placed in a microwave oven and heats it up, microwave radiation also changes the electrical properties of materials when placed in a microwave cavity. Microwaves interact differently with different materials. The measurable changes that microwave radiation induces in the dielectric parameters for various materials are different. The changes are unique for each type of plastic. Thus, carefully measured variations in dielectric properties of a pollutant in a microwave cavity can be used to identify the presence of a pollutant in a given sample.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The setup devised by IIT Bombay researchers consists of a microwave cavity around a foot long and attached to a network analyser, an instrument which can measure various electrical parameters. The sample is placed inside the cavity using a very thin glass tube as a sample holder, and an appropriate high-frequency microwave is passed through the cavity. Using the network analyser, the researchers recorded the variations in the electrical parameters of the sample due to the presence of plastic polymers. This technique can currently identify some of the most abundant types of plastics found in the environment, namely polypropylene, low-density polyethylene, high-density polyethylene, and cross-linked polyethylene. Most of our daily-use &lt;/span&gt;plastic materials like bags, bottles, ropes, carpets, and computer components are made of these four plastic polymers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;While the technique proposed by the IIT Bombay team is efficient, economically viable and has given good results on laboratory-made samples, it is yet to be tested on real environmental samples. “We have studied only four polymer types. In reality, there are other types of environmental plastic pollutants as well. Also, the sample size should be small, as the volume of the sample to cavity volume is very crucial,” Prof Eldho delineated the limitations of the study. The limitation on the sample size means that the technique cannot be used to identify the polymer type in the case of large-sized plastic pollutants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The group is currently trying to improve and expand the study by considering other frequencies of microwaves and more types of plastics seen in both environmental samples and biological materials. One of the major challenges they expect to face is in the design of the casing of the device and sample holder. The researchers plan to develop their technique into compact handheld devices that can be used widely to identify the presence of hazardous invisible plastic pollutants appearing almost everywhere. “A major challenge is the design of the casing and sample holder. Our studies with the prototype of the test sample holder show that it is very sensitive to perturbations in the testing conditions,” Dr Renjith explains the challenges ahead. The team is currently exploring options to address the issues with the sample holder and identify the best microwave frequency for real-world applications (to use in a device).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;By employing microwaves for plastic detection for the first time, the researchers have opened up new avenues of application for microwaves and novel possibilities in identifying plastic pollutants. If this laboratory-based technique can be developed into handheld devices, as the researchers hope, it will go a long way in helping manage the threats posed by micro and nano plastics.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;283&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Article written by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;424&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Arul Ganesh S S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;283&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Image/ Graphic credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;424&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Image credit: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Wikimedia Commons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;, Oregon State University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;283&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Gubbi Labs Link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;424&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128224&quot;&gt;A microwave-based technique as a feasible method to detect plastic pollutants in experimental samples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/engineering&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/technology&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/transportation&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Transportation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

You may just let it go and tell yourself to be regular henceforth. While the implications of missing a single dose of medicine may not be serious in many cases, not adhering to a strict dosing schedule may lead to serious problems in some medical conditions or diseases such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and eye diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Technology can be a saviour to people who cannot adhere to a dosing schedule due to a lack of skill to administer injections, conditions like dementia, or just plain reluctance. Wearable devices (wearables) and implantable devices (implants) can automatically administer the prescribed drug according to the body requirement and a pre-decided schedule. Wearables and implants help to reduce the unnecessary repeated dosing observed in conventional drug delivery systems. They release just the required quantity of drug in a controlled manner thereby acting for a longer duration and avoiding any toxic effects on the body, otherwise observed in treatments like chemotherapy. These devices have been around for a while now and can address the lack of timely drug intake. Wearable devices are worn on the body, like an insulin pump for diabetes or pharmaceutical jewellery for contraceptive purposes. Implants are placed inside the body, like a coronary stent put in an artery during angioplasty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Abhinanda Kar, Mahima Dewani, Lisha Awasthi and Runali Patil, from the Biosciences and Bioengineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, under the guidance of late Prof. Rinti Banerjee and Dr Nadim Ahamad, have published a comprehensive &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0142961222000746?via%3Dihub&quot;&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;of wearable and implantable drug delivery devices currently being explored globally. The researchers analysed the progress in wearables and implants over the past ten years, as well as the challenges in converting these technologies to clinical settings. As Dr Ahamad, corresponding author of this paper says, “The concept of many such devices is present on an experimental level from more than 15-20 years, yet they are not available clinically to the patients. Studying challenges is important to figure out what is impeding further use of these technologies.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Material and design requirements of wearables and implants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Wearables need to be comfortable to wear for a long duration without causing allergies or reactions. They should support easy control of the drug release and be easily replaceable without needing an expert. Implants need to be accepted by the body and should not trigger an adverse immune response. They should be implantable with minimum surgical procedure. Devices implanted in the eye need to be transparent. Wearables and implants should sustain daily body movements, hold enough amount and allow controlled drug release when used for drug delivery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Naturally-derived non-toxic and biodegradable materials such as chitosan, alginic acid, hyaluronic acid, lipids, proteins and synthetic biodegradable materials such as polylactic acid (PLA), polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), polycaprolactone (PCL), polyanhydrides, polyvinyl alcohol are commonly used to make wearables and implants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The shape of implants and wearables is governed by where they are going to be used. The shape and dimensions of wearables such as mouth guards, self-care textiles and pharmaceutical jewellery are custom-designed for the comfort of the specific user. Devices like microneedle patches, wound healing bandages, and insulin patches are worn on the skin, so it is not critical to have particular dimensions. The shape and design compatibility of implantable devices is very critical, especially in applications such as vascular stents. The design needs to be precise so that they are convenient to implant and seamlessly integrate with vascular tissues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;An array of drug delivery options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;When drugs are administered orally or using an injection below the skin or in a vein, the drug passes through a few body parts which are not meant to be targeted. This kind of conventional drug delivery has certain problems. A patient may need repeated doses. The medicine can create toxic reactions in the body parts other than the target area for drug delivery. Implants can deliver drugs directly to the target region and organ and reduce the possibility of a toxic reaction. In case of externally accessible tumours like breast cancer, head and neck cancer or oral cancer, devices &lt;/span&gt;such as hydrogel-based drug-depot and drug-releasing films deliver the drug only at the tumour site for a prolonged duration. This method can minimise adverse reactions otherwise observed in conventional chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Wherever wearable or implantable drug-delivery devices are available for cancer treatment, implants are more useful as they offer localised high drug dosage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Many people currently use insulin pumps, injectable pens or microneedle patches for insulin delivery in the body for diabetes management. An advanced self-powered electrothermal patch delivers insulin through the skin, and it penetrates even better than microneedle patches. Implants like injectable hydrogels, porous scaffolds, externally controlled insulin pumps and membranes made up of microfibers provide practical and reliable options for controlled delivery of insulin and other anti-diabetic drugs, thus addressing the problem of erroneous and irregular dosing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Implants in the eye administer drugs locally to a specific part of the eye. Biocompatible and non- toxic implants are tolerated well in the eye. Even if the material degrades due to physiological conditions, the residue it creates is non-toxic and washes away with tears.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Advanced wearable and implantable devices can adjust the drug release rate according to internal factors like body movement, sweat, tears, saliva and vaginal fluid, or external triggers like light, magnetic force or ultrasound. These devices are referred to as &quot;smart&quot; wearable devices. There are &quot;smart&quot; wearables and implants that can be controlled using wireless communication too. Such remotely controlled smart devices have tremendous potential in mobile healthcare, telemedicine and personalised medicine. An interesting finding related to this is a smart and multifunctional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aba3252&quot;&gt;contact lens &lt;/a&gt;for treating diabetic retinopathy. The lens simultaneously monitors the real-time glucose level in the tear fluid of the patient, and the patient or a healthcare provider can control the drug delivery via a wireless remote device, such that the drug gets absorbed across the cornea, sclera and retina. This contact lens was tested in the eye of a diabetic rabbit. The device showed very high sensitivity compared to standard and effective invasive procedures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Wearable technology finds use in the treatment of certain superficially located forms of skin cancers, breast cancers and oral cancer. Anti-cancer bandages, drug-releasing self-care textiles, wearable patches and devices with microneedle patches have been used to treat cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Contraception is one popular area where the wearables and implants are extensively explored for painless, affordable and long-acting drug delivery. They ensure the steady and reliable release of contraceptive hormones and avoid side effects like nausea, vomiting or irregular bleeding that oral contraceptives can cause. Pharmaceutical jewellery, drug-carrying self care textiles, intravaginal rings (IVRs) are some of the prominent developments in this area. Implantable &lt;/span&gt;devices can also provide contraceptive protection for several years. The very popular copper T is an example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Implants have found an important application in making coronary stents, which have revolutionised angioplasty treatment and saved millions of lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Challenges in making wearables and implants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Wearables can carry only a small dosage of the drug at a time, making them unsuitable for treating diseases which demand high drug dosage, for example, certain types of cancer. Generally, they are placed on the surface of the body, but body fluids like sweat, vaginal fluid, tears and saliva can detach them from the surface. Keeping them attached to the body surface is a problem that researchers need to address before we can use these devices regularly. Making a responsive and reliable device which can release the drug as per the body&#039;s requirement is another challenging task. Though there are some solutions to these issues, they are yet to be tested extensively in clinical settings.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Implants have their own set of challenges. An implantable device cannot be removed or replaced in the patient&#039;s body without a minor or major surgical procedure. The implants can be used for a longer duration if we increase the amount of the drug that they carry at a time. This requires appropriate biomaterial for making the device, and it is still a challenge to find such material. “The purpose behind this study was to summarise and highlight the latest developments in drug delivery. We also wanted to review challenges in this area. It will help to open the channel for future research and development.” says Dr Ahamad.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Due to the ease of usage, patient friendliness and appealing functionality, wearables and implants have the potential to become the crux of drug delivery technologies. The researchers say that, for wider acceptance of these technologies, further studies should focus on investigating device accuracies, long-term stability, long-term toxic effects and various psychosocial factors that need to be addressed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;width: 457px;&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;193&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Article written by:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;264&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;AshleshaGore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;193&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Image/ Graphic Credit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;264&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Image byScientifickly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;193&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Gubbi labs link:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;264&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2022.121435&quot;&gt;Wearable and implantable devices for drug delivery: Applications and challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/healthcare&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/technology&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The feat was celebrated widely across both academia and the industry as it can significantly boost both research and start-up ecosystems in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;India launched the Indigenous India 5G testbed project, a multi-institutional effort with contributions from five IITs (Madras, Hyderabad, Bombay, Kanpur, Delhi), the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, and two research labs (SAMEER and CEWiT). The project was funded by the Department of Telecommunications, Government of India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;IIT Bombay contributed to the development of the 5G core subsystem of the 5G testbed. Prof Mythili Vutukuru led the 5G core development team at IIT Bombay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is 5G? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;5G is the short form of the fifth-generation technology standard used in telecommunications for broadband cellular networks. In a cellular network, the communication between user devices such as mobile phones or tablets to the network base station is wireless. The geographical area a base station can service is called a cell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;5G is the successor of the currently prevalent 4G networks many mobile telecommunications companies offer. The 5G network technology promises to provide lesser latency. The annoying delay one experiences during a voice call is due to latency. 5G networks are set to have more data-carrying capacity, higher download speeds—up to 10Gbps, more users per cell, and smaller, compact base stations instead of big mobile towers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;5G networks will operate on a frequency range of 24 GHz to 52 GHz, which is different from 4G. Though high-speed transmission is possible at these frequencies, their range is low. Hence the base stations would need to be closer to each other. Additionally, the 5G technology would also support the 4G frequency range for higher transmission distance but relatively lower speed. 5G networks are set to integrate different technologies and components. In addition to human users, devices that use the Internet of Things could use 5G networks to connect to the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;For a nation to ensure its citizens also reap the benefits of new technologies, it has to invest early on in human resources, develop appropriate infrastructure, and create an enabling environment. The 5G testbed project has been taken up with these goals. The goal of the testbed project is to develop all components of the basic 5G system from the ground up in a production-grade standards-compliant manner and open these components to researchers and start-ups in India for their use in research, development, and production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 5G Core&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The indigenous 5G network developed as part of the 5G testbed project consists of the radio access network (wireless base stations and user equipment) and the 5G core network. The 5G core connects the wireless radio access network to external networks like the Internet. It enables services like voice, mobile broadband, and other novel applications. The core network is the brain of the telecom network and implements functionalities like user registration, authentication, data forwarding, billing, charging, mobility management, and policy enforcement. The core network plays a significant role in providing good quality of service to mobile users. The IIT Bombay team was responsible for designing and implementing the main components of the 5G core subsystem that anchor all of these functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The IIT Bombay team designed and implemented the 5G core components developed as part of the testbed using state-of-the-art design principles such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV). For faster development and better scalability, they built all 5G core components as scalable software that runs on commodity hardware (either on a cloud or bare metal). The components communicate over REST-based HTTP APIs, in accordance with the Service Based Architecture (SBA) design paradigm. The data plane components were developed over the high-performance Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) framework for efficient data handling at high network speeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Further, the 5G core in the testbed supports deploying Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) applications. A network has many exchanges and base stations connected to each other. The end-users, like mobile or broadband subscribers, are said to be at the edge of the network. To let customers process data with minimum latency, providers place data centers closer to the subscribers, that is, the edge of the network. Such a system is termed multi-access edge computing (MEC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The IIT Bombay researchers have also &lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9352907&quot;&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; a multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology, which is considered one of the critical enablers for technologies to meet the standards laid out by the International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT)-2020 standards for 5G communications. The researchers have demonstrated a full-fledged MEC architecture and integrated it with 5G core following European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) 5G specification with an application deployment use-case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;New technology has several goals and also offers many new possibilities. Whether a technology delivers the promised features depends on many factors, such as implementation and extensive deployment. The current 5G testbed allows various stakeholders to experiment and test their technologies and march towards a successful, efficient, and indigenous 5G ecosystem. It also provides opportunities for the country to be at the forefront of standardization efforts for 6G and beyond. More importantly, such indigenous development can greatly help in making India self-reliant and independent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;77*&quot; /&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;179*&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article written by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sudhira HS and Arati Halbe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image/ Graphics credit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;30%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gubbi Labs Link:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;70%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9352841&quot;&gt;Demonstration of 5G Core Software System in India’s Indigenous 5G Test Bed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9352907&quot;&gt;Development of MEC system for indigenous 5G Test-Bed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/engineering&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/technology&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Infrared light control at nano scale for quantum computation</title>

In valleytronics based quantum computing, valleys—local minima in the energy band structures of electrons—are used to encode, process and store information. One of the ways to switch the valley states is by using infrared light. Valleytronics based quantum computing would need low-cost infrared sources with selective control on the direction of light propagation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Researchers from IIT Bombay have proposed a new technology platform that uses voltage to control the intensity of light emission and the direction of light propagation. It can be used to control valley states for quantum computing and also to detect chemical molecules, perform biological imaging, or design a brighter light source. The researchers have used a heterostructure of graphene—a two-dimensional material whose optical conductance can be controlled using voltage, and alpha molybdenum trioxide—another layered two-dimensional material whose optical properties are different in different directions—to create the platform. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/nanoph-2022-0034/html&quot;&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;was published in the journal De Gruyter Nanophotonics. The study was funded by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. The current research is the first time researchers have used voltage to control light in an alpha molybdenum trioxide and graphene heterostructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Two-dimensional materials are becoming more and more significant due to their unique and unusual properties, making them suitable for quantum computing and nanotechnology. They are in the form of one-atom-thick sheets. This sheet material exhibits some interesting properties, different from the bulk form of the same material. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The proposed heterostructure has a thin film of alpha molybdenum trioxide over a silicon substrate. On top of alpha molybdenum trioxide is a single layer of graphene attached to a terminal called the gate. The gate is used to apply voltage. The intensity of infrared emission due to the interaction of infra-red light with electrons in graphene can be controlled using voltage. However, more useful and exciting applications are possible if the direction and polarisation of the light can be controlled too. Alpha molybdenum trioxide is an interesting material in which the permittivity of light in different directions in a plane is different. Light of a specific polarisation is blocked in one direction but passes through in another direction. The combined properties of the two materials give rise to a fascinating light emission pattern in the heterostructure plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;docs-internal-guid-c189712a-7fff-4a8a-15be-515de3cd58a1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;border: none; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: 432px; height: 288px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vmGn_CHhHoIaZhP6a1Ju9njBBa47W1mZwiJrF_cYBe5cCJzY3xyy67COg9BhMIb56xoKfUQ-Cy_4Zpv4_IcKSnMUxJcjypylVnvf1h0AwZwGGlP5wOQESgo_iZFLSM3krhxn6Rig6gdYz6aFoQ&quot; width=&quot;432&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Image: The spontaneous emission pattern of the researchers’ heterostructure shows an interesting pattern as the gate voltage changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;―The heterostructure provides the benefit of large operational bandwidth and higher propagation distance which we do not obtain from any one material individually. Along with that, we can control the direction of propagation either by using voltage or the polarisation state of the incident light, or both, says Dr Saurabh Dixit, a researcher of the current work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The researchers made use of the Purcell effect, a quantum phenomenon that suggests that spontaneous emission of light from a molecule can be enhanced by changing the dielectric permittivity (the ability of a material to store electromagnetic energy) of the medium surrounding it. ―We leverage the Purcell effect phenomenon by using voltage to tune the dielectric permittivity of the proposed platform using graphene. Being able to control the emission pattern of light from an emitter in the vicinity of the proposed platform thus allows one to address the valley qubit easily, says Mr Aneesh Bapat, a researcher of the current study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The researchers used mathematical analysis and computer simulations to analyse the properties of the proposed heterostructure. They showed that the proposed platform could provide a convenient way to realise valleytronics devices. ―This is an important development since the technology for applying precise voltages is already mature even at the nanoscale. Hence our approach makes it easy to bring an on-chip realisation of valleytronics based quantum circuits, says Prof Kumar, who led the research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The platform can also be used for other applications such as sensing biomolecules and cooling nano sized electronic circuits. It opens new avenues for applications in quantum interference, gate tunable planar refraction devices, emission pattern engineering and quantum field entanglement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;width: 100%;&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;128*&quot; /&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;128*&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Article written by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arati Halbe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image/ Graphic Credit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientifickly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gubbi Labs Link:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;50%&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1515/nanoph-2022-0034&quot;&gt;Gate tunable light–matter interaction in natural biaxial hyperbolic van der Waals heterostructures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/engineering&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/science&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/technology&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>The World&#039;s First Quantum Tunneling Enabled Spiking Neural Network Chip on 45nm SOI Technology from India</title>

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quantum Tunneling enables Ultra-Low Area and Power Neural Network for Brain Scale Computing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-scale Computing is a Decadal Challenge &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The biology of the brain enables approximate computing with analog synapses that connect stochastic and digital spiking neurons. Along with fascinating connectivity schemes, this results in the power &amp;amp; mystique of the biological brain that chaperones all the processes of human thought and action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;As humans build next-generation AI-powered sensors &amp;amp; computing, the biological brain remains an inspiration and an enigma! A measure of understanding the brain enigma is our ability to build a brain-like computing platform. A successful brain-scale emulator could enable revolutionary advancements from sentient autonomous, self-learning bots to understanding diseases of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Mainstream computing technology using transistors to make digital gates has taken over the world. This technology enables Boolean logic with Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) of transistors to form complex circuits including microprocessors. Yet, mimicking a complex mix of analog, stochastic, and digital processing in the biological brain at scale using traditional digital computing technology has significant inefficiencies. This makes brain-scale computing, i.e. replicating the brain with its 100 billion neurons with 1 quadrillion (i.e. 1000 trillion) synapses, a daunting task. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adapting Silicon Technology to Mimic the Brain&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;A promising approach is to adapt the mature silicon technology by leveraging hitherto untapped physics to design &amp;amp; build efficient neurons and synapses to create neuro-synaptic cores. These cores are akin to microprocessor cores, except for working on biological principles of computing. To ensure an efficient core, the neuronal design must be very energy and area efficient. This requires a compact and ultra-low current source in silicon technology – a central challenge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;In 2021, the researchers from IIT Bombay led by Prof. Udayan Ganguly proposed the use of quantum tunneling current in a silicon on insulator (SOI) technology as a solution. The quantum tunneling current levels are close to the off-current level of a traditional transistor. The off-current is 10000 times smaller than the typical on-currents used in transistors. This enables significant power and area savings! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;To take the innovation to the next systems level, a device-circuit-algorithm co-design team was formed led by Prof. Udayan Ganguly and Prof. Maryam Shojaei Baghini at IIT Bombay. Together, the team has designed the global first spiking neuro-synaptic core on 45nm SOI technology enabled by quantum tunneling. The team coordinated remotely from their respective homes during Covid 19 lockdown, thanks to the online computing infrastructure at IIT Bombay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Algorithm-Circuit-Device Co-design by IIT Bombay Team&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The application was speech recognition using a neural network algorithm inspired by the auditory cortex. A spoken word recognition algorithm, the Liquid State Machine, uses the idea that the neural network forms a neuronal reservoir which is analogous to a liquid reservoir. Spoken words are like liquid droplets falling on the reservoir surface creating ripples. The ripples capture the memory of the spoken word in time to enable a simple classifier layer to classify accurately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;A graduate student Vivek Saraswat worked on adapting this algorithm to hardware by adding the various hardware quirks to the conventional “ideal” software implementations to show the feasibility of the hardware implementation. The quirks include variability and non-linearities of “physical” elements like neurons and synapses implemented on silicon technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Another graduate student, Ajay Singh, led the circuit demonstration. He implemented a 20-neuron input layer that fed the neural spike signal into a 36-neuron reservoir where neurons were connected in a random recurrent manner through 256 synapses. Some of the critical hardware “quirks” identified in algorithms were mitigated through design. A key challenge was that tunneling is by nature exponentially dependent on the input voltage to produce a non-linear current source. However, software algorithms assume a linear current source. Ajay designed correction blocks to enable “ideal” neurons. Such control ensures that the large body of algorithms can be implemented in our hardware directly without redesign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieving performance using 45nm Silicon Technology at GlobalFoundries&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The neural network circuit was designed &amp;amp; fabricated on the mature 45RFSOI technology. The chip manufacturing was supported through the prestigious GlobalFoundries University Program. Dr. Ted Letavic, CTO of Compute and Wired Infrastructure Business Unit at GF commented that “This is pioneering work that showcases the advantages of mature SOI technology to demonstrate a new neural compute paradigm based on quantum tunneling.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;As the world’s first neuro-synaptic core leveraging quantum tunneling in advanced SOI technology, the study has been recently accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions of Circuits and Systems in 2022. The IEEE publication highlights that the team has achieved 5000 times lower energy-per-spike at a similar area, 50 times less area at a similar energy-per-spike, and 10 times lower standby power at a similar area and energy-per-spike compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks. Such overall performance improvement enables brain-scale computing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI chips from India’s innovation ecosystem for global leadership &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;As semiconductor ecosystem development becomes a national priority with the cabinet approval of the 10 Billion USD investment in India and AI Hardware development acquires global focus, Prof. Ajay Sood, Principal Scientific Advisor (PSA) to the Government of India remarked “Demonstrating silicon-proven ideas based on an untapped quantum phenomenon in silicon to build efficient brain-like computing is promising on the global scale. The confluence of the national semiconductors priority as well as the emergence of AI and brain-scale computing hardware as the R&amp;amp;D focus at the global level makes the demonstration very timely and compelling.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;The work was initiated under DST Nanomission and later supported by Nanoelectronics Network for Research &amp;amp; Applications (NNetRA) funded by MeitY &amp;amp; DST. On an IIT Bombay team achieving this milestone, Dr. V.K. Saraswat, Member, NITI Aayog commented that “India has excellent strength in circuit design. Advanced technology-circuits-systems co-design is the “holy grail”. A new computing hardware platform demonstrated by the IIT Bombay team based on advanced devices-circuit-system co-design is an exemplary demonstration. It contains the essence of the deep knowledge of technology, device, and circuits developed in the Centers of Excellence in Nanoelectronics (CENs) leading to such pathbreaking inventions. As a next step, brain-scale computing enabled my nanoelectronics should become a major thrust in India’s S&amp;amp;T program to amplify the scope and ambition of such research towards new products and capabilities.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;colgroup&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;73*&quot; /&gt;&lt;col width=&quot;183*&quot; /&gt;&lt;/colgroup&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;28%&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Article written:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;72%&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;28%&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Image/ Graphic Credit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;72%&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt; Ankit Bende&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;28%&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;Link to preprint:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;72%&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot; align=&quot;justify&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1008844/v1&quot;&gt;https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1008844/v1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en-US&quot; align=&quot;justify&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2022.3172176&quot;&gt;Quantum Tunnelling based Ultra-compact and Energy Efficient Spiking Neuron enables Hardware Liquid State Machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/engineering&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/technology&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Technology is approaching the limit of how small and dense electronic circuits can become. Researchers are exploring new materials, technologies and atomic properties to pack more processing power in a smaller and smaller area. Another problem dense circuits face is that of heating. The microprocessor in our mobile has millions of a few nanometers (millionth of a millimetre) wide transistors. When millions of transistors are furiously switching between the logic states ‘0’ and &lt;/span&gt;‘1’ at lightning speed on a chip of about 1 cm x 1 cm, the heat density can be enormous. To keep up with the burgeoning demand for computational power along with energy efficiency, we need to explore novel technologies. Valleytronics is one such promising technology that can achieve our goals. It allows quantum encoding of information, thus opening the doors to the hot topic of quantum computing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undergraduate student Koustav Jana, and Prof Bhaskaran Muralidharan of the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), Mumbai, have proposed a device structure for a valley polariser---an integral part of valleytronics systems. It is analogous to the optical polariser in optics. The proposed design is robust, all-electrical, and hence can be seamlessly integrated with modern electronics and could be fabricated using the existing fabrication techniques. The design suggests using two dimensional (2-D) materials—single-atom-thick sheets of certain materials. Their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41699-022-00291-y&quot;&gt;research &lt;/a&gt;was published in npj 2D Materials and Applications. The study was funded by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) and the Ministry of Education (formerly MHRD) Computers use only ‘0’ and ‘1’ to represent information and perform logical operations. We can represent the numbers using any convenient scheme, such as a lever that can be up or down or a switch that is ON or OFF. So far, the logic circuit and memory technologies have been using only the electrons’ electrical charge and related properties. The two binary states, ‘0’ and ‘1’, are associated with the flow of electrical charge, also called the electrical current or the lack of it. Researchers are currently exploring quantum properties of electrons, like the spin and the valley degrees of freedom. The valley degree of freedom corresponds to certain local extrema in the electronic band structure in 2D materials, which can be used to create the two binary stable states. Exploiting the so-called ‘valley’ degree of freedom for information processing, analogous to the spin degree of freedom in spintronics, is known as ‘valleytronics’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable valley states in two-dimensional materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to quantum theory, electrons act as particles and also exhibit wave-like properties. In most materials, while studying their properties at the macroscopic level, we “encapsulate” the quantum effects into compact and effective quantities, like effective mass and conductivity. However, there is a special class of materials in which the wave nature of electrons and the corresponding “quantum-ness” needs to be considered even at the macroscopic scale and are rightfully known as quantum materials. Many 2-D materials fall in this category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Graphene is an extensively researched quantum material that is a two-dimensional form of carbon and has a hexagonal lattice structure. Silicon, germanium and tin, other group-IV materials (they have four valence electrons) like carbon, also have similar 2-D forms called silicene, germanene and stanene, respectively. These materials, called 2D-Xenes, have an interesting property. Under certain conditions, the bulk behaves like a conventional electrical insulator, but at the boundary of the sheet, the materials possess conducting channels that can carry current very easily, with almost no resistance. “It is like the difference between travelling on the chaotic city roads vs the highways, which have dedicated lanes for traffic,” explains Prof Bhaskaran. “Such conducting channels can also be engineered as per our requirements, in the bulk of these materials,” adds Koustav Jana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Two-dimensional-Xene materials also possess two valleys, which are designated as K and K’. These ‘valleys’ are minima in the energy description of these materials, which is commonly referred to as the band structure. For using valley states to represent logic states efficiently and &lt;/span&gt;reliably, the valley states need to be stable, controllable, and robust to material defects and disorders. This can be achieved by electrically engineering robust valley-polarised conducting channels in 2D-Xenes. The lattice structure of silicene, germanene and stanene show buckling; that is, the atoms in lattice are not exactly in the same plane but are slightly above or below the plane of the structure. This buckled structure allows for electrical control of the distinct stable valley states. An important step toward manipulating these valleys is their spatial separation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Previous research shows that these valleys can be spatially separated using light or a magnetic field. However, using light or magnetic fields to control the states can be inconvenient while using valleytronics devices in today’s appliances. Devices routinely use a voltage supply to operate, so controlling valley states using electric voltage makes it convenient to integrate these valleytronics devices into modern-day electronics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The IIT Bombay device design&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IIT Bombay researchers have proposed a device structure with a single layer of 2-D Xene material as the charge carrying channel. A terminal called a gate controls the electric current flowing through the channel, similar to how a gate controls the current in the modern transistor design. The gate structure, which is also used to create the valley separation, sandwiches the 2-D Xene ribbon. The top and bottom gates are split into two parts—say A and B—along the direction of the current flow. Top-A and bottom-B are connected to the positive terminal, and top-B and bottom-A are connected to the negative terminal of the supply to have opposite electric fields on either side, A and B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.iitb.ac.in/sites/www.iitb.ac.in/files/reshigh/2022-05/pic2A.jpg&quot; width=&quot;1023&quot; height=&quot;563&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The interesting split gate structure ensures that the valley-polarised interface states are spatially separated and also robust against typical disturbances due to material defects and disorders.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;“The proposed structure can be realised experimentally using existing gating technologies used in typical transistor structures. The design allows seamless integration with modern-day electronics,” informs Prof Bhaskaran.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The researchers did extensive quantum device modelling simulations to calculate the conductance and valley polarisation at different temperatures. They observed that the conductance increases, but valley polarisation degrades with increasing temperature. The researchers also studied how the device performs in the presence of disturbances. They observed that the material’s conductance remained unchanged as the strength of the disturbance increased, but the valley polarisation degraded.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The researchers also presented an analysis to help optimise the device parameters, such as the material and the gate separation width, to achieve the intended capability in terms of the conductance and valley polarisation. “We believe that our work opens the door for researching the utility of using 2D-Xene materials for possible applications in valleytronics and spintronics,” say the researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Article written by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;358&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Arati Halbe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Image/ Graphic Credits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;358&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Lead Image : Scientifickly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Inline Image : &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41699-022-00291-y/figures/1&quot;&gt;npj 2D Materials and Applications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;247&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Gubbi Lab links&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;358&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &#039;Times New Roman&#039;,&#039;serif&#039;; mso-fareast-font-family: &#039;Times New Roman&#039;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;&quot; lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;page-break-before: always; mso-break-type: section-break;&quot; clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41699-022-00291-y&quot;&gt;Robust all-electrical topological valley filtering using monolayer 2D- Xenes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/engineering&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/technology&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The traditional biological explanation is that an odour molecule latches with a matching receptor in the inner-nose cells (like a key into a lock); the process triggers molecular events in the cell, stimulating nasal neurons. Finally, the signals from the neurons reach the brain, where they are interpreted. An unorthodox theory is that molecules give off odour depending on how the atoms in the molecules vibrate and how their mass is distributed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;There is a huge demand for odour sensors to detect drugs, food chemicals, and in security and defence sectors. However, the physics of smell is not very well understood, and currently, we often rely on sniffer dogs for odour detection. Scientists need to know the physical processes that happen at the molecular level that cause odour in molecules in order to make better odour sensors. Hence, understanding the physical processes of smell and representing them mathematically is an active research area. Another opportunity that this understanding could enable is the artificial synthesis of molecules with desired odour properties, very similar to the synthesis of drug molecules with targeted therapeutic properties.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;A team of researchers from the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) led by Prof Swaroop Ganguly have inched closer to interpreting the physics of smell. The researchers used quantum biology techniques to gain insights into the molecular behaviour of the odour molecules. Quantum biology is a newly &lt;/span&gt;emerging field that facilitates scientists to study subatomic processes in biological phenomena such as smell (like how the atoms vibrate in odour molecules), where macroscopic physical theories fail to explain the processes. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90592-x&quot;&gt;results of their experiments &lt;/a&gt;are published in Scientific Reports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The widely accepted theory of olfaction is the shape theory, which says that the odour molecules are like keys that fit into the lock-like patterns of receptor molecules in cells, triggering the molecular sequences. “However, in&lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8985605/&quot;&gt; 1996, Turin &lt;/a&gt;et al. proposed that the sense of smell depends on how the atoms in the odour molecules vibrate, and there is some experimental evidence to show that vibrational energy plays a role in the sense of smell,” says Prof Ganguly. In this theory, it is the vibrational energies of its molecules that imbue odour to the substance. The current study tries to map the shape theory and the vibration theory to each other and find their relationship.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The team considered 20 molecules belonging to six odour categories - musk, roasted coffee, fruity, garlicky, aromatic compounds (benzene) and mothball. They classified the molecules in two ways: i) based on the perception of smell reported by expert human subjects (for example, say a ‘fruity’ or ‘garlicky’ smell); ii) based on the vibrations of the molecules.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The first challenge for the team was to represent the shape of the molecule mathematically to decipher the subtle aspects that cause odour. For this, they employed a technique called Chemical Graph Theory. The chemical graph representation, in this case, is a network of points (which correspond to the atoms in the molecule) connected by lines (corresponding to the chemical bonds between the atoms). The same network may be viewed as a ball and spring network system in a mechanical setup. Chemical bonds hold each atom by a spring-like force. Each spring has its vibrational frequency of oscillation, and together these oscillations generate the vibrational energy of the molecule. Using this graphical representation, the team described the relation between the shape and vibrational energies of a molecule, thereby unifying the shape and vibration theories of odour.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;“The vibrational characteristics of odour molecules is a spectrum (a range of energies for different modes of vibration). It depends on the number of atoms in the molecule and how they are bonded to their neighbouring atoms (the push-pull of the spring-like forces). The complexity increases for two- and three-dimensional representations,” explains Ms Nidhi Pandey, first author of the study. We have derived a new way to represent the vibrational spectrum that takes into account not just the vibrational energy but also the mode type, she adds. A mode is the dynamical pattern of atomic vibrations in a molecule, such as a change in the length of the chemical bond (stretching); change in angle between bonds (bending); change in angle between a group of atoms (rocking); and change in planar angle between a group of atoms and the rest of the molecule (wagging).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Next, the researchers used standard machine learning algorithms to group all molecules that have similar vibrational spectra, using a mathematical measure of ‘similarity’. They then compared this classification with the groupings based on the perception of a smell. &lt;/span&gt;“We wanted to compare based on how they were vibrating (mode of vibration) rather than a simple comparison of vibration energies, to bring more physics insight into the machine learning exercise,” says Prof Ganguly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;The team found that molecules categorised using the vibrational spectrum matched the perceptual smell-based category.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;This study thus brings to light the possibility of correctly identifying an odour using mathematical means and opens exciting avenues for digitizing odour - just like audio and video signals that are routinely sensed, stored, transmitted and reproduced today.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;229&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Article written by&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;487&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Susheela&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;229&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Image/ Graphic Credits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;487&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Image from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pexels.com/photo/breakfast-close-up-coffee-coffee-cup-460257/&quot;&gt;Pexels &lt;/a&gt;https:/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pexels.com/photo/breakfast-close-up-&quot;&gt;/www.pe&lt;/a&gt;x&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pexels.com/photo/breakfast-close-up-&quot;&gt;els.com/photo/breakfast-close-up-&lt;/a&gt; coffee-coffee-cup-460257/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;229&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt;Gubbi Lab Links:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot; width=&quot;487&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span lang=&quot;EN-US&quot; xml:lang=&quot;EN-US&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-details-url field-type-link-field field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Link to published work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90592-x&quot;&gt;Vibration-based biomimetic odor classification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-research-domain field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Research Domain:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/engineering&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/en/research-domain/technology&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot; datatype=&quot;&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
