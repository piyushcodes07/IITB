                <TD align="left" valign="top" class="BodyText">The Financial Assistance is provided as per the guidelines approved by the BoG meeting held on 21st June 2013 (Item No. 11, 219th meeting of BoG). The Assistance is granted to a Research Scholar through his/her faculty supervisor. The norms approved are as follows. <br><br><b>N1.</b>Support would be granted according to Scheme G1 or Scheme G2 described below. Most Research Scholars/Project Staff would be granted support according to Scheme G1; some selected categories of Research Scholars would be granted support according to Scheme G2, based on the consideration that those categories of Research Scholars are also expected to seek support from their parent organizations. The description following G2 includes a mention of which Research Scholars are marked out for support as in G2. Project staff would normally be considered for support according to Scheme G1. If that is not feasible due to unavailability of sufficient funds or for other reasons, then support for them according to Scheme G2 shall be considered.<br><br>
<b>Schemes G1 and G2 for Support:</b><br><br>



<b>Scheme G1.</b>This is applicable for all Research Scholars except those listed under the Scheme G2 below, as also to most project staff as explained in Norm N1 above. The Support granted would be as follows:
<br><br>
For conferences/workshops/symposia organized within
<br><br>
(a)Group A : North America, Australia, South America, New Zealand: Rs.150,000/-<br>
(b)Group B : Europe, Far-East Asia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, Africa: Rs. 140,000/-<br>
(c)Group C :Neighbouring Countries, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma, Pakistan, Gulf Countries, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Maldives: Rs. 100,000/-<br>
<br><br>


<b>Scheme G2.</b>This is applicable only to Research Scholars belonging to the Sponsored (SW) and College Teacher (CT) Categories, not normally resident on campus. It is also applicable to project staff, only when they cannot be granted support according to Scheme G1 for one or more reason(s).
<br><br>
For conferences/workshops/symposia organized within
<br><br>

(a)Group A : North America, Australia, South America, New Zealand: Rs. 75,000/-<br>
(b)Group B : Europe, Far-East Asia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Indonesia, Africa: Rs. 70,000/-<br>
(c)Group C :Neighbouring Countries, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma, Pakistan, Gulf Countries, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Maldives: Rs. 50,000/-<br>
<br><br>



The above amounts are inclusive of the following:<br><br>
i)Travel,<br><br>
ii)Registration fees,<br><br>
iii)DA (including local travel, food bills and local stay as given below)

<br><br>
Maximum admissible DA rates are given in Table below:

</tr></table>
<br><br>
Columns (a) & (b) indicate maximum admissible DA rates that can be <u>claimed out of the total amounts</u> indicated in Scheme G1 and G2 as per details given below:
<br><br>
Column(a): The maximum permissible amounts on account of DA that can be claimed per day (without production of any bills or receipts). Such DA shall be permissible for the days of the Conference and one day each prefix and suffix to the Conference.<br><br>

Column (b): Maximum permissible DA including hotel bill with payment proof in original for days of Conference and one day each prefixed and suffixed to the Conference.
<br><br>
The advances provided under Scheme G1 & G2 have to be settled as per Institute norms for proof of travel and stay.
<br><br>


<b>N2.</b> Students in the Doctoral (Ph.D., Dual Degree Master's+Ph.D.) Programmes only would be given support.
<br><br>
<b>N3.</b> Project Staff (PS) would be considered separately in a different queue for support from funds made available from the IRCC.
<br><br>
<b>N4.</b> Efforts to maintain an equitable distribution of support to the extent feasible to most academic units would continue, as has been the case to date.
<br><br>
<b>N5.</b> When the need arises to make such a distinction, conferences/workshops with a more stringent review process/ more demanding standards for acceptance would be given priority.
<br><br>

A Research Scholar can secure only one support before the Conference i.e. either financial assistance from the institute or refundable advance against grants from other agencies, e.g. CSIR/DST/INSA/AeSI/DBT etc., to meet the total expense.
